# Productive Deployment Guide

## About this Guide

This is a productive deployment guide for self-hosting a functional MDS Connector.

## Prerequisites

### Technical Skills

- Ability to deploy, run and expose containered applications to the internet.
- Ability to configure ingress routes or a reverse proxy of your choice to merge multiple services under a single domain.
- Know-how on how to secure an otherwise unprotected application with an auth proxy or other solutions fitting your situation.

### Dataspace

- Must have a running DAPS that follows the subset of OAuth2 as described in the DSP Specification.
- You must have a valid Connector Certificate in the form of a .p12 and a password.
- You must have a valid Participant ID / Connector ID, which is configured in the claim "referringConnector" in the
  DAPS.
- You must have a Postgres database available and a Hashicorp instance. If not, feel encouraged to use the provided docker images.

## Deployment Units

To deploy an EDC multiple deployment units must be deployed and configured.

| Deployment Unit                                                   | Version / Details                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| An Auth Proxy / Auth solution of your choice.                     | (deployment specific, required to secure UI and management API)   |
| Reverse Proxy that merges multiple services and removes the ports | (deployment specific)                                             |
| Postgresql                                                        | 16 or compatible version, one for the EDC-data one for the LH-data|
| Hashicorp Vault                                                   | 1.8.4 |
| Connector                                                         | MDS-EDC |

## Configuration

### Reverse Proxy Configuration

To make the deployment work, the connector needs to be exposed to the internet. Connector-to-Connector
communication is asynchronous and done with authentication via the DAPS. Thus, if the target connector cannot reach
your connector under its self-declared URLs, contract negotiation and transfer processes will fail.

The MDS connector opens up multiple ports with different functionalities. They are expected to be merged by a reverse
proxy (at least the protocol endpoint needs to be).

- The MDS EDC Connector is meant to be deployed with a reverse proxy merging the following ports:
  - The MDS connector's `8182` port. Henceforth, called the Management API.
  - The MDS connector's `8183` port. Henceforth, called the Protocol API.
  - The MDS connector's `8185` port. Henceforth, called the Public API.
- The mapping should look like this:
  - `https://[EDC_HOSTNAME]/api/dsp` -> `edc:8183/api/dsp`
  - `https://[EDC_HOSTNAME]/public` -> `edc:8185/public`
  - `https://[EDC_HOSTNAME]/api/management` -> **Auth Proxy** -> `edc:8182/api/management`
- Regarding TLS/HTTPS:
  - All endpoints need to be secured by TLS/HTTPS. A productive connector won't work without it.
  - All endpoint should have HTTP to HTTPS redirects.
- Regarding Authentication:
  - The Management API need to be secured by an auth proxy. Otherwise, access to either would mean full control of the application.
  - The connector's `8183` and `8185` ports need to be unsecured. Authentication between connectors is done via the Data Space Authority / DAPS and the configured certificates.
- Exposing to the internet:
  - The Protocol API and the public API must be reachable via the internet.
  - Exposing the Management Endpoint to the internet requires an intermediate auth proxy, we recommend restricting the access to the Management Endpoint to your internal network.
- Security:
  - Limit the header size in the proxy so that only a certain number of API Keys can be tested with one API-request (e.g. limit to 8kb).
  - Limit the access rate to the API endpoints and monitor access for attacks like brute force attacks.

### Vault Configuration
Add a key pair for securing the data plane and the DAPS certificate to your vault with the same names used in the connector configuration.
See our helper script `init_vault.sh` for guidance.

## FAQ

### Can I run a connector locally and consume data from an online connector?

No, locally run connectors cannot exchange data with online connectors. A connector must have a proper URL + configuration and be accesible from the data provider via REST calls.

### Can I change the Participant ID of my connector?

You can always re-start your connector with a different Participant ID. Please make sure your changed Participant ID is deposited in the DAPS as new Contract Negotiations or Transfer Processes will validate the Participant ID of each connector. Both connectors must also be configured to check for the same claim.

After changing your Participant ID old Contract Agreements will stop working, because the Participant ID is heavily referenced in both connectors, and there is no way for the other connector to know what your Participant ID changed to.
